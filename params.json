It can save you hundreds of clicks in a day when editing and managing your Grafana dashboards. It can also be used to store dashboards in a Github repo making Grafana dashboards version controlled.\r\n\r\n# Understanding the use case\r\n\r\nWe want/need to edit and modify dashboards everyday and managing tens and hundreds of dashboard becomes hard for a Grafana user and as well as an administrator. To manage Grafana dashboards on command line makes it easier for the users who prefer keyboard over hundred of clicks. `wizzy` brings you that power to change dashboards on your command line. Together we can make it better and rich in terms of commands it support.\r\n\r\n# Flow\r\n\r\n1. A user makes a local directory to store dashboards and initialize it with Git version control.\r\n\r\n2. Then the user imports and make a copy of the dashboard(s) in the local directory so that changes can be made on these imported dashboards.\r\n\r\n3. The user uses `wizzy` cli tool to modify dashboard or dashboards and export it back to Grafana to replace the old one.\r\n\r\n4. The user also can push it to a Git repo once he is done making changes to track what changed on a dashboard.\r\n\r\n# Getting started with wizzy\r\n\r\n- Install nodejs by downloading it from nodejs.org. (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After installing nodejs, run following commands:\r\n```\r\n$ node -v\r\n$ npm -v\r\n```\r\nNote: Please make sure node version is above 5.10.1.\r\n\r\n- Install wizzy using npm\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g wizzy\r\n\t- Use sudo if needed or permission was denied\r\n$ wizzy version\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a Github repo for storing dashboards\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir grafana-dash\r\n$ cd grafana-dash\r\n$ git init\r\n\t- optional step to store dashboards in a github repo\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Initialize wizzy\r\n```\r\n$ wizzy init\r\n```\r\n- Set Grafana properties in wizzy's config\r\n```\r\n$ wizzy set grafana url GRAFANA_URL\r\n\t- a required setting to connect to Grafana installation\r\n$ wizzy set grafana username USERNAME\r\n\t- if anonymous access to Grafana is disabled.\r\n$ wizzy set grafana password PASSWORD\r\n\t- if anonymous access to Grafana is disabled.\r\n```\r\nNote: Add `conf` directory to .gitignore to avoid checking your credentials into git repo.\r\n\r\n- Test wizzy setup\r\n```\r\n$ wizzy status\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are ready to use wizzy.

This is an optional setting for some commands and mandatory for other commands, which makes wizzy cli more intuitive and user-friendly.\r\n```\r\nwizzy set context dashboard DASHBOARD_SLUG\r\n```\r\nNote: Once context is set, wizzy will use this dashboard as default if no dashboard is supplied.
